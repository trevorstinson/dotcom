# Hi! My name is Trevor Stinson.

I'm a [software developer](https://github.com/trevorstinson) who used to [podcast](http://betterworlds.net/) and [blog](/blog) a little. I like reading books, computering, befriending animals, and gaming (video or tabletop; special consideration for [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/trevorstinson)).

You can reach me on Mastodon at [@trevorstinson@indieweb.social](https://indieweb.social/@trevorstinson) (where I mostly talk about _Star Wars_ and web development) or by email (rarest-dobro0y@icloud.com â€” this is a masked address which I cycle out periodically).
