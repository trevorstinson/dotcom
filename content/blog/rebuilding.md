My personal site has been on Statamic for years. There's really no reason for my site to need real hosting, so I am moving things over to [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev), a lightweight static site generator which should more than meet my needs. Eleventy is also a better fit for my usual tech stack. Statamic is built on PHP/Laravel, and I never really did much with those. Eleventy is written in JS, where I feel more at home.

I've been delaying making a move for a while because I wanted to get everything in order first, but I'm calling it. I'm pulling the plug on the old site now, and I will rebuild piece by piece. I'm starting from Eleventy's [base blog starter](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) and I will customize and add what I need as I go. It's ok that the styles are not all in place from the beginning. It's ok that I'm starting over.

	Here it is.
