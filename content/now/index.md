## Right now I am:

**Reading**

- [_Provenance_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provenance_(novel)) by Ann Leckie
	- I lucked into an advance reader copy of her next book, _Translation State_, and realized I had entirely missed this previous Imperial Radch book (despite loving the Ancillary trilogy).
- [_The Amateur's Mind_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85261.The_Amateur_s_Mind) by Jeremy Silman
	- My last over-the-board tournament made me want to start improving again. I previously started Silman's _Reassess Your Chess_, but found it a bit beyond my current strength. This was recommended widely as a good option to build up to _Reassess_.

**Watching**

- _Abbott Elementary_
- _The Owl House_

**Playing**

- _Destiny 2_ with my friends.
- _Borderlands 3_ with my other friends.
- _Jedi: Survivor_ when I'm on my own.
- [Chess](https://www.chess.com/member/trevorstinson), always. Shoot me a friend request or a challenge.
